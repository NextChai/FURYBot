# Fury Bot
The Discord Bot for the FLVS Fury School Discord. The FURY bot allows works to lock down a school discord, now allowing any links or profanity.

Unfortunately, I am including the list of profanity based words in the repo. This is strictly for educational purposes, and is not something that should be used to be abused.

# Features
Auto moderation of members who:

- Have a bad status,
- Have a bad Discord name,
- Have a NSFW pfp,
- Post non-authorized links,
- Use swears or any non PG-related terms
