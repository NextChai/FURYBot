Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the licensor ("Owner") grants you, the recipient, a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive right to use, modify, and create derivative works of the licensed material, solely for non-commercial purposes and exclusively for the purpose of contributing to the original project.

2. Commercial Use Prohibition
The licensed material and any of its derivatives may not be used for commercial purposes by any party other than the original Owner. "Commercial purposes" include, but are not limited to, offering the material or derivatives for sale, or using it in services or products provided for a fee.

3. Distribution Restrictions
No person or entity, except the Owner, is permitted to distribute, sublicense, publish, or share copies of the licensed material or its derivatives in any manner, whether modified or unmodified, either privately or publicly.

4. Modifications and Contributions
You may modify the licensed material solely for the purpose of contributing to the original project. However, you may not distribute or publicly use such modifications outside the context of contributing to the original project. Any modifications must not alter the original state of the material for harmful or malicious purposes and must not misrepresent themselves as the original licensed material.

5. Private Use
You are permitted to use and modify the licensed material in private, provided that such modifications are exclusively for the purpose of contributing to the original project, and are not intended for public distribution, commercial use, or misrepresentation.

6. Patent Rights

7. Trademark Rights
This license does not grant you any rights to use the name, logo, or trademarks of the Owner or contributors, whether explicitly stated or implied. Use of the licensed material must not suggest any endorsement by the Owner.

8. Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the licensed material is provided "AS IS" without any warranties or conditions, express or implied. The Owner shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the material, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Termination
Your rights under this license will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the licensed material and any derivatives in your possession.

10. Governing Law
This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Owner resides, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
