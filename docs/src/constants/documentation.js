                    that highlight team member attendance and performance, enabling moderators to easily identify members \
                    who may be slacking off. Additionally, the Fury Bot Leaderboard System displays the top teams based on their total \

                            The use of Fury Bot's Practice Session feature is essential to accurately record and monitor these practices.\n \
                            Initiating a Fury Bot Practice Session is a straightforward process, requiring only a single slash command. To start a session, \
                            connect to your team's voice chat and enter the command "/practice start." Fury Bot will then track your team members as they join \
                            and leave the voice chat, providing a complete record of your practice session.\n \
                            Once all members have left the voice channel, the practice session will end and your statistics will be updated. \
                            Please note that it may take up to 10 minutes for your practice time to be reflected on the leaderboard.`,
